## Roadmap

### RAP Builder & CDS End-to-End Tests
- Scaffold RAP integration tests covering full data model creation.
- Steps include DDIC tables, interface CDS views, projections, group activation, BDEF metadata, and service bindings.
- Extend builder APIs (tables, views, behavior definitions, binding helpers) to orchestrate RAP end-to-end scenarios.
- Add CDS-specific ABAP Unit coverage that leverages generated doubles and service projections.
- Provide dedicated integration suite separate from existing builder tests.
