/**
 * Capture raw ADT wire exchanges — normal answers AND refusals — into
 * `corpus/adt/`, so a consumer's result and error strategies can be written
 * against real documents instead of imagined ones.
 *
 * It talks to the public surface of this package directly: the public `AdtClient` /
 * `AdtUtils` surface builds correct requests (XML payloads, lock handles,
 * content types); a thin interceptor on `connection.makeAdtRequest` — the
 * single funnel every one of those calls goes through — captures each raw
 * exchange (method, URL, status, headers, unparsed body) byte for byte.
 *
 * DURABILITY: every exchange is written to disk THE MOMENT it is captured
 * (see `Recorder.record`), not buffered for a final flush. A session that
 * dies mid-run (an expired JWT, a network drop) still leaves everything
 * captured before that point on disk.
 *
 * ORDER: refusal cases run first, normal reads last. Refusals are the half
 * this script exists for and the ones that need the scratch object; normal
 * reads are cheap to redo if a run gets cut short.
 *
 * ABORT ON CONNECTION LOSS: `withCase` distinguishes an ADT-level refusal
 * (the request completed; SAP sent back a real HTTP response, error or not)
 * from a connection-level failure (no response at all — expired token,
 * network reset, timeout). The former is expected and swallowed; the latter
 * is rethrown, stops the whole run immediately, and is reported by `main`'s
 * top-level handler — it does NOT run an auth command or open a browser.
 *
 * QUERY PARAMETERS: `makeAdtRequest` takes the query string as a separate
 * `params` option, and much of adt-clients uses it (core/shared/nodeStructure
 * passes `parent_name` there, so does `update` for most object types). The
 * interceptor records `params` explicitly and also stores an `effectiveUrl`
 * with the query string folded in. Without this, every nodestructure exchange
 * records the same bare `/sap/bc/adt/repository/nodestructure` and the object
 * whose tree was asked for is simply absent from the corpus.
 *
 * WHAT THE RECORDED HEADERS ARE: the caller's custom headers, not the full
 * wire headers. The connection adds its own below this interception point —
 * the default Accept, `sap-adt-connection-id`, the stateful-session trio, the
 * CSRF token and the Authorization header. That is why no credential can
 * reach the corpus by construction: this code never sees one.
 *
 * MANIFEST: each run appends `_run-<timestamp>.json` recording every case,
 * its outcome and its exchange count, so a later reader can tell a case that
 * was never attempted from one that was attempted and answered nothing.
 *
 * Every capture is scoped by `withCase(name, fn)`. Setup calls made outside a
 * `withCase` block (creating the scratch class, locking it for bookkeeping)
 * are NOT persisted — only console-logged — so the corpus holds exactly the
 * named cases, not incidental plumbing. Teardown runs in a `finally`, so an
 * aborted run does not strand the scratch class on the system.
 *
 * Side effects on the SAP system: creates ONE scratch class
 * (`SCRATCH_CLASS_NAME` below) in `environment.default_package`
 * (src/__tests__/helpers/test-config.yaml), exercises it (lock/unlock/update/check/activate/
 * delete), and deletes it at the end. Never touches the 29 restored shared
 * polygon objects (`ZMCP_SHR_PKG`) beyond reading them.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/capture-adt-corpus.ts [--env <path>] [--only a,b,c]
 *                                         [--empty-package ZNAME]
 *
 * Default --env is the prepared trial session
 * (~/.config/mcp-abap-adt/sessions/trial.env).
 *
 * `--only` captures just the named cases, for topping a partial corpus up.
 * The scratch class is created only when a case that writes to it is
 * selected; `delete-success` on its own reuses a class left by an earlier
 * aborted run instead of making a new one.
