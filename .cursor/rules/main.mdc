# mcp-abap-adt-clients Rules

## Language Requirements
All repository artifacts authored by the assistant (source code, documentation, comments, commit messages, etc.) must be written in English.

Direct communication with the user must follow the language used by the user in the current conversation.

## Project Context
- **Name:** mcp-abap-adt-clients – ADT clients for SAP ABAP systems
- **Purpose:** Provides Read-only and CRUD operations for SAP ABAP ADT objects
- **Key Modules:** `src/clients/`, `src/core/`, `src/utils/`, `src/__tests__/`

## Code Standards
- Source code: English only
- Comments: English only, explain "why" not "what"
- Variable/function/class names: English only
- Error messages: English only
- Log messages: English only

## Version Management

**CRITICAL: NEVER change package.json version without explicit user request**

- Always ask the user before modifying the `version` field in `package.json`
- **When adding entries to CHANGELOG, always ask the user which version they plan to use for the package**
- Do not automatically increment version numbers
- Do not change version numbers when updating CHANGELOG
- Version changes must be explicitly requested by the user
- Use `npm version` command only when explicitly requested

## Architecture Notes
- Client classes: CrudClient, ReadOnlyClient
- Builder pattern: All object types have corresponding Builder classes
- Low-level functions: Located in `src/core/*/` modules
- Testing: YAML-based configuration in `tests/test-config.yaml`
